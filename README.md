# Chronicler

Write once, copy to platforms, archive locally.

## What is Chronicler?

Chronicler is a lightweight web app for managing a social media cross-posting workflow. It's built for people who want to:

- Write content in one place before copying it to multiple platforms
- Keep a local archive of everything they post, organized as Markdown files

## What it doesn't do

Chronicler doesn't post to social media for you. It doesn't require authentication with any platform. It doesn't store your data on a server — everything stays in your browser until you archive it to your own filesystem.

## Who it's for

Probably just me. I wanted a central place to write my content and the convenience of copying it to social media platforms, plus an easy way to archive everything to my Obsidian vault.

If it's useful to you too, great.

## Running it locally

- Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
